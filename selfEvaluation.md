# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
On a scale of one to ten i am a six, i understand the concept. But need more practice.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I had to do someoutside reasrch and that was hard, i would call it a productive struggle.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I just more practice doing for loops. 
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
How do you get input from the user?
